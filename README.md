# Web_History_SWE
My project was to make a web site about "WWW and Sweden Web History" Then compare the UI/UX with the classmates, and get feedback from them. Web Site is Swedish!  Feedback : I showed my website to my classmates and they said "The whole Site is basic background, fonts and colors it looks like a web page from 2000 but the functions are great every function works no bugging." My Thought : I tried to make it seems like a old page because the page is about Web History/old times..
